```

This diagram illustrates the current core components and how they interact within the Bun runtime, as well as potential future additions.

### Component Responsibilities

*   **Developer/User:** Interacts with the application via CLI commands during development or as a user of a deployed service.
*   **Bun Runtime:** The execution environment for the TypeScript code. It handles parsing, compilation, and execution, and provides built-in utilities for package management.
*   **Core Application Logic:** Represents the main processing flow of the application. Currently, this is a simple "Hello World" log, but it's the heart where all future business logic will reside.
*   **`index.ts`:** The primary entry point and main source code file for the application. All core logic starts here.
*   **`package.json`:** Defines project metadata, scripts, and manages project dependencies and dev dependencies. It's crucial for project setup and running.
*   **`tsconfig.json`:** Configures the TypeScript compiler, specifying how TypeScript files are processed, what language features are enabled, and output options.
*   **Future Enhancements (Placeholder):**
    *   **Web Frontend:** A potential separate client-side application (e.g., React, Vue, Svelte) that consumes services from this backend.
    *   **Database / Data Storage:** For persisting project information, user data, etc.
    *   **External APIs / Services:** Integration with third-party services for enhanced functionality.

### Technology Stack
*   **Runtime Environment:**
    *   **[Bun](https://bun.sh/)**: A fast, all-in-one JavaScript runtime, bundler, and package manager.
*   **Language:**
    *   **[TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)**: A typed superset of JavaScript that compiles to plain JavaScript, offering enhanced tooling and maintainability.
*   **Configuration:**
    *   **`package.json`**: For project metadata and dependency management.
    *   **`tsconfig.json`**: For TypeScript compiler options.

## üöÄ Getting Started
This section will guide you through setting up and running the `weekly-project-showcase-sp-25` application on your local machine.

### Prerequisites
Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

*   **Bun**: The JavaScript runtime.
    *   **Version Requirement:** `bun v1.1.42` or higher.
    *   **Installation:** Follow the instructions on the [Bun website](https://bun.sh/docs/installation).
        ```bash
        # Example for macOS/Linux via Homebrew:
        brew install oven-sh/bun/bun
        # Or via npm (requires Node.js):
        npm install -g bun
        ```
    *   **Verification:**
        ```bash
        bun --version
        ```

### Installation
Clone the repository and install the necessary dependencies using Bun:

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/GDSC-FSC/weekly-project-showcase-sp-25.git
    cd weekly-project-showcase-sp-25
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    bun install
    ```
    > [!NOTE]
    > `bun install` is significantly faster than `npm install` or `yarn install` for most projects.

[‚¨ÜÔ∏è Back to Top](#-table-of-contents)

### Configuration

<details>
<summary>Expand for detailed configuration information</summary>

The project uses `package.json` for general project configuration and `tsconfig.json` for TypeScript-specific settings.

#### `package.json`
This file defines scripts, dependencies, and project metadata.

```json
{
  "name": "weekly-project-showcase-sp-25",
  "module": "index.ts",
  "type": "module",
  "devDependencies": {
    "@types/bun": "latest"
  },
  "peerDependencies": {
    "typescript": "^5.0.0"
  }
}
```
*   `name`: The name of your project.
*   `module`: Specifies `index.ts` as the main entry point.
*   `type`: Set to `"module"` for ES module support.
*   `devDependencies`: Dependencies required only for development (e.g., `@types/bun`).
*   `peerDependencies`: Specifies compatible versions for `typescript`.

#### `tsconfig.json`
This file configures the TypeScript compiler. It ensures that your TypeScript code is compiled correctly and adheres to best practices.

```json
{
  "compilerOptions": {
    "lib": ["ESNext", "DOM"],
    "target": "ESNext",
    "module": "ESNext",
    "moduleDetection": "force",
    "jsx": "react-jsx",
    "allowJs": true,
    "moduleResolution": "bundler",
    "allowImportingTsExtensions": true,
    "verbatimModuleSyntax": true,
    "noEmit": true,
    "strict": true,
    "skipLibCheck": true,
    "noFallthroughCasesInSwitch": true,
    "noUnusedLocals": false,
    "noUnusedParameters": false,
    "noPropertyAccessFromIndexSignature": false
  }
}
```
*   **`lib`, `target`, `module`**: Configure the target JavaScript version and module system.
*   **`strict`**: Enables a wide range of type-checking validation. Highly recommended for robust applications.
*   **`noEmit`**: Tells TypeScript not to emit JavaScript files, as Bun handles compilation directly.
*   **`moduleResolution: "bundler"`**: Optimizes module resolution for bundlers like Bun.

#### Environment Variables (Future)
For future enhancements, you might need environment variables for API keys, database connection strings, etc. Bun supports `.env` files out of the box.

*   Create a `.env` file in the root directory:
    ```
    PORT=3000
    DATABASE_URL=postgres://user:password@host:port/database
    ```
*   Access them in your code:
    ```typescript
    console.log(process.env.PORT);
    ```

</details>

[‚¨ÜÔ∏è Back to Top](#-table-of-contents)

### Running the Application

1.  **Run in Development Mode:**
    To run the application, simply execute the `index.ts` file using Bun:
    ```bash
    bun run index.ts
    ```
    You should see the output:
    ```
    Hello via Bun!
    ```

2.  **Production Deployment (Future Considerations):**
    For a production environment, you would typically build the application into a single JavaScript file and then run that compiled output. Bun handles this efficiently.
    
    *   **Build (if needed for a specific target/environment):**
        ```bash
        # This project uses `noEmit: true` in tsconfig, so Bun compiles on the fly.
        # For a full build, you might use bun build or a dedicated bundler.
        # Example (conceptual for larger projects):
        # bun build ./index.ts --outdir ./dist --target bun --minify
        ```
    *   **Run Production:**
        ```bash
        bun run ./dist/index.js # Assuming a build step creates a dist folder
        ```
        For this specific "Hello World" project, `bun run index.ts` directly executes it efficiently in any environment.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Always ensure your Bun version meets the project's requirements for optimal compatibility and performance.

### FAQ (Frequently Asked Questions)

<details>
<summary>Expand for FAQs</summary>

**Q1: What is Bun?**
A1: Bun is an incredibly fast all-in-one JavaScript runtime, bundler, transpiler, and package manager designed to be a drop-in replacement for Node.js, Webpack, Babel, and npm/Yarn. It's written in Zig and powered by Apple's WebKit JavaScriptCore engine.

**Q2: Why use Bun instead of Node.js?**
A2: Bun offers significantly faster startup times, execution speeds, and dependency installation. It also includes built-in features like a module bundler, test runner, and TypeScript support, simplifying the development toolchain.

**Q3: How do I add new dependencies to the project?**
A3: You can use Bun's built-in package manager, similar to npm or Yarn:
```bash
bun add <package-name>
bun add -D <dev-package-name> # For development dependencies
```

**Q4: Can I use JavaScript instead of TypeScript?**
A4: While the project is configured for TypeScript (`index.ts`), Bun can execute plain JavaScript files (`.js`) directly. However, we strongly recommend using TypeScript for better code quality and maintainability in a collaborative project.

**Q5: My Bun command isn't working, what should I do?**
A5:
1.  **Check Bun installation:** Run `bun --version` to ensure Bun is installed and in your PATH.
2.  **Verify project dependencies:** Run `bun install` to make sure all packages are correctly installed.
3.  **Check command syntax:** Double-check the command you're trying to run (e.g., `bun run index.ts`).

**Q6: How can I contribute to the project?**
A6: Please refer to the [Contributing & Development Guidelines](#-contributing--development-guidelines) section for detailed instructions. We welcome all contributions!

        ```bash
        rm -rf bun.lockb node_modules
        bun install
        ```
    2.  **Check network connection:** Ensure you have a stable internet connection to fetch packages.
    3.  **Check Bun version:** Ensure your Bun version meets the project's prerequisites.
    4.  **Clear Bun cache:**
        ```bash
        bun cache clean
        ```

**Problem: `bun run index.ts` gives a TypeScript error**
*   **Solution:**
    1.  **Check `tsconfig.json`:** Ensure your `tsconfig.json` is correctly configured as provided in this repository.
    2.  **Lint your code:** Look for syntax errors, missing types, or incorrect imports in your `index.ts` or other `.ts` files. Bun will transpile TypeScript on the fly, but it still expects valid TypeScript.
    3.  **Verify `@types/bun`:** Ensure `@types/bun` is correctly installed in your `devDependencies` (check `package.json` and `bun.lockb`).

**Problem: Application starts but doesn't do anything**
*   **Solution:** In its current state, the application only prints "Hello via Bun!" to the console and then exits. If you see this output, the application is functioning as intended. Any future features would involve more complex outputs or server interactions.

**Problem: Unable to clone repository due to permissions**
*   **Solution:**
    1.  Ensure you have read access to the repository.
    2.  If you're contributing, you should first `fork` the repository to your own GitHub account and then clone your personal fork.
